## README

# Focus Buddy

Now hosted on heroku! https://focusbuddy.herokuapp.com/

This is the React.js side for my first React.js project, backend found here: https://github.com/SLarkworthy/focus-timers-backend2

# DESCRIPTION

Together with the front end, this project allows a user to make an account to save timer cycles to improve productivity and mental wellbeing. These timer cycles are cycles of work time and break time that remind people to take frequent breaks and stay focused for a set amount of time. A timer can be set to a desired length of time for both work mode and break mode, and different lengths can be saved for each activity. There is also a random affirmation on the homepage.
